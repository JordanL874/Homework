    "Three of the datasets will be used to establish the differing poverty rates within the OECD and also prove that the USA has one of the more extreme and prevelant poverty gaps. They also contain historical data, which I will extend as far back to the 1980s to show that the rates have remained largely the same. I have several datasets that show social spending expenditures throughout the OECD. I will use these charts to first show in what areas these countries are spending: pensions, family indicators, how wealth dispartities measure, as well as benefits and wages, which will establish how these countries are funding their anti-poverty programs. Through data visualization in tableau, I will be able to see correlations, which will help to establish the questions that I'm intending on answering. "
