My image inspires me because something that I want to be able to do at the end of this course is to present data to a group of stakeholders. I want to be able to educate people on important trends and present a well-thought out and cohorent analysis that will improve on systems and knowledge. I also find this image inspiring because, at the end of the course, I hope to be someone who has gained an invaluable skillset that will keep me current and competitve with ongoing techoloogical changes.
